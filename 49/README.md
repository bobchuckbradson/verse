#49

It's not about religion or anybody's fate
It's just a lie we tell each other to conceal our hate
We never learn our lesson, we egg each other on
We call for blood on posters that we plant into our lawn

Give in to emotion, make outrageous claims
Freedom to oppress and freedom from both fact and shame
Some claim they want justice, then list whom they want hanged
Hate and bigotry replace the anthem freedom rang

Artificial problems, false authority 
Superficial interface replaced society
What's the motivation now to keep a civil tongue?
Imprison all dissenters and indoctrinate the young

We who call for safer streets, we're the ones deranged 
The massacres increase in frequency but nothing's changed
Ugly fat-cats summarize much hatred in one line
No empathy to spare for the Orlando 49

Our compassion is compromised
Our inaction is realized
Our own poison shall we imbibe
Made our choice, social suicide

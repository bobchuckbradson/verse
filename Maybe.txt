Maybe life is more than what we see
Maybe life is more than you and me
Maybe truth is more than what we know
Maybe wisdom's more than where we go
Maybe you've been told a lot of lies
Maybe you believe in their disguise
Maybe it's a joke for all to see
Maybe it's just all a joke on me
Maybe it's a dream and I'll awake
Maybe you don't realize what's at stake
Maybe if you win we all will lose
Maybe the best choice is not to choose
Maybe we're all fucked no matter what
Maybe I should keep my big mouth shut
Maybe hate is what we all deserve
Maybe I don't mind striking a nerve
Maybe I have so much more to say
Maybe not enough time in the day...

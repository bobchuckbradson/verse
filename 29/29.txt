Can't believe I'm really 29
Maybe i should act like an adult
Maybe I should stay between the lines 
Maybe i should lead a great revolt

Gotta get on top of my own life
Gotta gain some ground on giving in
Must remember what it's like to strive
Easy life's a breeding ground for sin

Take advantage of the chance you get
Know nobody offers help for free
Betting on yourself is your best bet
Relying on others has a fee

Wind seems always blowing in my face
No way to forestall both time and tide
Building karma on my fall from grace
Fate and fortune rarely coincide

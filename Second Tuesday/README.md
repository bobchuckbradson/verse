#Second Tuesday

If we open up our hearts and open up our minds
2017 could be like 1969
Hate replaced with love
The eagle flying with the dove
Never underestimate 
The power love can generate

Sorest of the losers are the first to place the blame
Sometimes you must ante up to get into the game
Neighbors trading hate 
Instead of trying to relate  
Rich man, poor man, foreign man
We live our lives the best we can

Hypocrites and nihilists engage in politics
Candle of the GOP is burning at both wicks
Trade reason for flash
A demagogue with phony cash
The best to hope if Trump wins, true's
A bloodless military coup

Ignorance and prejudice can manifest as fear
Project our insecurities on those that we find queer
Some will blame the few
They have a narrow point of view
Radicals will polarize
And invent sides and terrorize 

We can fight the power with the power of our vote
Democracy: our sword and shield, our ramparts and our moat
Don't give up the fight
To the dark terrors of the night
Remember to remember
Second Tuesday in November

It's probably not too bad to be a zombie
A lack of brain activity sounds to to me
Maybe then I'd find a way to get some rest
Without the beating of this drum echoing in my chest

I probably wouldn't be the greatest zombie
The crunch of bones has visceral affects on me
The sight or thought of blood will make me nauseous
I proabably wouldn't be the best at eating human flesh

--

I'd rather be a zombie
Don't mean to sell myself so cheap
I mean, I'm already a creep
But if zombies were real, then I'd never ever get any sleep

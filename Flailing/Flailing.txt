Sinking in quicksand
Struggle and drown
No one lends their hand 
Slowly slip down

Walking up the downside of the escalator
Swim against the undertow and get swept out to sea
Never finish now what you can fail at later
Buried in the avalanche, you won't recover me

Kicking and screaming
Throwing a fit
Storming and steaming
Losing my shit

Thrashing and flailing
Crying in vain
Trying and failing
Going insane

I haven't slept much for weeks
I'm overwhelmed and harried
No rest for wicked like me
Until I'm dead and buried

I can't stop shaking sometimes
Regardless of the weather
Can hardly keep shut my eyes
My eyelids rough like leather

My legs are restless tonight
No chance of peaceful slumber 
My eyes can find every light
My ears are full of thunder

--

Crack my neck, Iâ€™m gonna break my neck some day
Pop my fingers from the pain
Rub my eyes and try to think of things to say
From the tangle in my brain

I'm not asleep / I'm not awake / I'm not a human
Feel like a freak / I'm gonna break / down into ruin

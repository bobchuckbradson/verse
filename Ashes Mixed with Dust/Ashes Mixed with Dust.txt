Measure sleep in milligrams 
Doubling the dose
Panic starts at 5 am
Peace is never close

Broken heart and jumbled mind
Wasting all away
Mix in all the times I've sinned
Nothing more to say

Every day another dollar
Wasted down the drain 
Every day worsens my pallor
Nothing pure remains

--

Every night I have to settle
Hardly any sleep
Every day an uphill battle
Hill is getting steep

Everywhere i choose to go
No one know my name
Guess I'm not a friendly guy 
Maybe I'm just lame

--

Ashes mixed with dust
Oxidize to rust
Deaden any lust
Ashes mixed with dust

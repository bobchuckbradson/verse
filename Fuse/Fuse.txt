Too hot to sleep for weeks Too noisy in my head
Sad eyes and sunken cheeks I'm walking like the dead
Somebody save me from this nightmare that I live
Somebody give me some of what they have to give

I'm feeling like a free, I'm looking for a fling
This nihilistic streak will ruin everything
Depression rules my mind, my loneliness inflamed
Never let's me unwind, my reticence unreigned

A termor in my hand that turns into a quake
Not sure that I can handle all that is at stake
A quasar in my brain won't let me go to sleep
It's driving me insane, I'm sinking down too deep

No sleep til Brooklyn, but you'll want to watch the road
Three thousand miles; what's the chance that we'll explode?
We gave up long ago to fix the things we break
I never took it slow, now I'm always awake

--

I'll never come down from this trip I'm on
This thought cacophony continues til my mind is gone
It's like my brain's a brightly burning fuse
And there's no way I've found, this flame will never be diffused

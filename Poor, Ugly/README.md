#Poor, Ugly

Wasted all my sunny days off wasted
Never let my life get in the way
Any chance of freedom, I've erased it
What a way to waste a precious day

Lost my chance to be a great creator
Too old now to make a lasting mark
Kick myself for starting so much later
Race around me, I was stuck in park

--

I feel poor, I feel ugly
Inadequate and underscored
Give me more, over drug me
Keep me safe from being bored

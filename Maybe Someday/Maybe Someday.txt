Maybe someday I'll be more than nothing to her
We could fly to the stars
We could orbit the earth

Maybe someday I'll be more than nothing to her
We could ransom the moon
For whatever its worth

Maybe someday I'll be more than nothing to her
We could dance in the sun
We'd create such a stir

Maybe someday I'll be more than nothing to her
She'd absolve me of sin
And so I'd become pure

Maybe someday I'll be more than nothing to her
But she's out of my league
Of this I know for sure..

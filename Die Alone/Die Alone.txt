If I die alone, at least I had a chance with you
Blew it, but it's more than many others get to do
If I never love again, I only blame myself
Maybe I deserve this slowly draining mental health

Happiness a moving target I can't seem to hit
Not sure what went wrong; I used to be so skilled at it
Sleep now so elusive that I never catch a glimpse
Nothing seems to calm my brain despite countless attempts


Wearing pennies on my eyes / I'm sleeping with my head against a stone
In this moment I realize / There's a good chance I'm gonna die alone


All the world is in my way while asking for a trick
Give me a damn minute, maybe I'll have something slick
Every inch I cede expands beyond the eye can see
Sure it's flattering but it will be the end of me

Maybe love and brilliance won't both fit inside my head
Get distracted by the other body in my bed
Maybe had I chosen love, peace comes along for free
If it comes around again will I choose differently?


No need to resuscitate / You're only wasting energy and breath
Never underestimate / The need for peace so swiftly solved by death
Wearing pennies on my eyes / I'm sleeping with my head against a stone
In this moment I realize / There's a good chance I'm gonna die alone

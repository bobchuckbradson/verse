Sixty choosings later, we've made a dozen score
Maybe if we're lucky we'll make a decade more
Virtues we were built on crumbling away
Nothing keeping hatred or bigotry at bay

Shore to shore we boil, Letting feardom ring
Giving up on reason, react to everything 
Losing our humanity, losing self respect 
Railing 'gainst both vulgar and politically correct

Lawmen shooting children, then profit from our pain
Weakening dued respect, what little still remains
All of us a suspect, so many heinous crimes
Someone who might mend this world is surely doing time

Everyone who's different here's your chance to flee
You're no longer welcome here if you don't look like me
Do your self a favor, pack your things and run
Don't you know that Paradise is for the chosen ones?

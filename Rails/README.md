#Rails

Running off the rails again, I've always struggled with the straight and narrow
Coloring outside the lines but whats the fun in being so confined
Wanderlust is in my blood, a nomad gypsy to my very marrow
Life is an adventure and I'm getting weary of this daily grind

Always marched to my own drum; but no doubt i got music, i got rhythm
Never on the same page, never even on the same side of the shelf
Self control is new to me, but I think it's by far the best decision
When i let my hair down ego has it's chance to supersede myself

Lost in my own mind, taunted by time, both day and night, speeding and dragging
Constant thoughts can keep me up for days, a cranky craze, its all a haze
Too fast to get out sometimes you'll find my mouth has tendency for lagging
Hope it's just a phase, but I can never seem to get out of the maze

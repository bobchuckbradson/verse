#Alone

Not sure why i choose to be alone
Guess I'm still unhappy with my life
Hope it doesn't reflect in my tone
No one else need know about my perceived strife

Not sure when i lost my happiness
Used to laugh so easy what went wrong?
Think it happened 'fore i ventured west
Looking for a muse to help me sing my song

Something someone once said comes to mind
Freedom means there's nothing left to lose
Maybe that's why I feel so confined
House of cards I'm building on a pleasure cruise

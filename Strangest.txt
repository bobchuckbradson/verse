The other night I had the strangest dream
Nothing out of place, everything was just as it seemed
What's the world without a mystery 
Future holds the truth but it's buried in history

The other day I had the strangest thought 
I had never earned a god damn thing that I have got
Whatever I'll make it on my own
I don't need your charity, can do it all alone

The other day I met the strangest guy
Lives in my own mirror and he looks me in the eye
Guess I'm still looking for an answer 
This confusion just keeps eating me like a cancer

The other day I found the strangest find
Something buried deeply at the bottom of my mind
Surely shook me to my very core
Life is so much bigger than what we choose to ignore

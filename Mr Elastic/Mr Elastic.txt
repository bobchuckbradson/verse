Drowning in your questions
The meetings never end
How can I deliver what you won't let me begin?

Every conversation 
The story stays the same
Feeling like I'm being played my life is but a game

Cycle keeps repeating 
Day after wretched day 
Not sure how I can explain it any other way

Ground down to a powder
I'm milled into a meal
Flail me with the cat o' nine and flense me with your steel

Torch me like a pyre
Just burn me to the wick
Stretch me thin to snapping, call me Mr Elastic

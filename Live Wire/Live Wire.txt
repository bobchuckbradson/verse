Night after night my head is on fire
Thousands of thoughts zip around in my brain
Breaking me down, perpetually tired
Trying to stay on the right side of sane

Night after night my heart is on fire
Lonely and longing to be made complete
Smoldering ashes of burning desire
My hope for a fairy tale falls to my feet

Night after night my bed is on fire
Burning with passion with no one to share
Making connections as such a live wire
Has dangers abound, take a chance if you dare

#Lonely Drone

I am a lonely drone / Looking for a place to call my own / Trying to find my way back home

You're the stars in the sky / Far above the air in which birds fly / Too far for me to even try

I have a foolish heart / Always seem to tear it all apart / It hurts less to not even start

Looking for love that's true / Someone who can understand me too / Looking to forget loving you

#Breaking Eggs

If you want to fall in love you know you're probably going to sing some blues
If you want to make it to the top you're never finished paying dues

Leave it up to fate, and you will find no one will give you your big break
But be careful what you wish for 'cause this world is only give and take



King of the bruise when you make it to the top of rock bottom
Nothing to lose, they say "beggar's can't choose", well you taught 'em

If you go around breaking those eggs
You might get lucky with an omellete
But don't act so surprised if you only end up with a mess



You can make a lot of money, but you'll never buy the life you've spent
You can buy a lot of houses, but you'll never rid yourself of rent

Don't you go and sell your soul to Satan for a chance of major green
Don't leave your heart or head behind while you're so busy switching scenes



Sleeping on the street, you'd rather trip than make ends meet that's pretty fucked
No judgement from me, you be whatever you must be and best of luck

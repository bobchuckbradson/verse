Just remember this,

Love conquers over hate.

Where hate cowers and flees, Love defends until bitter end.

Love is not selfish. Love is patient and fearless, and that makes Love strong.

hate is reckless. It's obtuse. It's easily used.

Where's the reward in hate? Where's the satisfaction? The pride?

hate covets the riches of Love.

Love can make us fools, that's true. Love can be our downfall. Our weakness. Our doom.
And hate seems to have numbers. 

But the power of love can shine through the darkest days. It can endure years of abuse. It can withstand immense pain.

It can change our lives. It can blow our minds. It can give our lives new meaning in an instant.

hate has nothing on Love.

Don't let go of Love.

Don't give into hate, whatever happens.

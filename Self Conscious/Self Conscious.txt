Well I’m pretty self conscious when it comes to my toes
And I’ve got a little scar underneath my nose
Everybody’s got a blemish, too I suppose
Something that they don’t want to expose

Have a habit have to stare in everybody’s eyes
Maybe I’m just looking for a hole in their disguise
Paranoia escalates while society dies
Truth is just a convergence of lies

Careful not to show my hand before you ante in
Been fucked over several times I won’t get fooled again
Keep my cards close to my chest to shield a broken heart
Never need to end what you don’t start

Thought I had a reason for each of my mistakes
But laziness and boredom does not a motive make
Thought I had an alibi for avoiding any vows
Owner of a heart so lonely, now
